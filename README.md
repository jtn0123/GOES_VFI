A PyQt6 GUI application for creating smooth, high-quality timelapse videos from satellite imagery using AI-powered video frame interpolation.

## What is GOES-VFI?

GOES-VFI transforms sequences of satellite images into smooth timelapse videos by intelligently generating intermediate frames between existing images. It's particularly designed for GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) imagery but works with any PNG image sequence.

### Key Capabilities:
- **AI Frame Interpolation**: Uses RIFE (Real-Time Intermediate Flow Estimation) v4.6 to create smooth transitions between frames
- **Satellite Image Enhancement**: Applies false color processing to infrared satellite data for better visualization
- **Professional Video Output**: Produces high-quality MP4 videos with customizable encoding settings
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple GUI that guides you through the entire process

## Architecture Overview

GOES-VFI is structured using modern software architecture patterns to maximize maintainability and extensibility:

* **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** The GUI is organized using the Model-View-ViewModel pattern, which separates the user interface (View), presentation logic (ViewModel), and backend/data processing (Model). This decoupling makes the codebase easier to test and extend.
* **Decoupled Pipeline Components:** The core processing pipeline is modular:
    * **FFmpeg Command Builder:** Constructs and manages FFmpeg command invocations for encoding and filtering.
    * **ImageProcessor Interface:** Abstracts image processing steps, with concrete implementations such as `ImageLoader`, `SanchezProcessor`, and `ImageCropper`.
    * Each pipeline stage is independently testable and replaceable, supporting future enhancements.

## Requirements

* **Python:** 3.13+ required.
* **Packages:** See `requirements.txt` (mainly `PyQt6`, `numpy`, `Pillow`). Install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* **FFmpeg:** Required for video processing/encoding. Must be installed and available in your system's PATH.
* **RIFE v4.6 ncnn:** The `rife-cli` executable and associated model files (`flownet.bin`, `flownet.param`) are expected.
    * The application looks for `rife-cli` in `goesvfi/bin/rife-cli` relative to the package installation.
    * The model files (`flownet.bin`, `flownet.param`) need to be placed within a model directory (e.g., `goesvfi/models/rife-v4.6/`). The GUI auto-detects folders named `rife-*` in `goesvfi/models/`.
    * *Ensure you have obtained the RIFE v4.6 ncnn executable and model files and placed them correctly.*
* **Development Tools:** For contributors, the project uses pre-commit hooks and various linters:
    * [`black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Code formatter (line length: 88)
    * [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) - Style guide enforcement
    * [`isort`](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) - Import statement sorting
    * [`mypy`](http://mypy-lang.org/) - Static type checking
    * [`pylint`](https://pylint.org/) - Advanced code analysis
    * Install all with: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` (if available) or individually

    a. **Download RIFE executable:**
       - Get the `rife-cli` executable for your platform
       - Place it in: `goesvfi/bin/rife-cli`
       - Make it executable on macOS/Linux: `chmod +x goesvfi/bin/rife-cli`

    b. **Download RIFE model files:**
       - Create directory: `goesvfi/models/rife-v4.6/`
       - Download and place these files inside:
         - `flownet.bin` (the neural network weights)
         - `flownet.param` (the network parameters)

5.  **Verify installation:**
    ```bash
    python -m goesvfi.gui --help
    ```

    This should display the help message without errors.

2. Launch GOES-VFI and select the folder
3. Choose frame rate and quality settings
4. Generate interpolated video

### Focusing on Specific Regions
1. Load your image sequence
2. Use the Crop tool to select your area of interest
3. Process only the selected region for faster rendering

### Batch Processing Multiple Sequences
1. Use the examples scripts for automation
2. Process multiple folders programmatically
3. Apply consistent settings across all videos

## Configuration

GOES-VFI uses a standardized configuration mechanism for core settings:

* **Primary Configuration File:**
  The main configuration is stored in a TOML file located at `~/.config/goesvfi/config.toml` (on Linux/macOS) or the platform equivalent (e.g., `%APPDATA%\goesvfi\config.toml` on Windows).
* **Configuration Management:**
  The module `goesvfi/utils/config.py` is responsible for loading this TOML file and providing default values for all core settings, such as:
    * Cache directory
    * Logging level
    * Paths to RIFE/Sanchez executables and models
    * Other pipeline and application options
* **UI State Persistence:**
  Some user interface state (such as window geometry, last-used directories, and certain UI preferences) may still be saved using `QSettings` (platform-specific location).
  **Note:** Only UI state is managed by `QSettings`; all core configuration is handled by the TOML file.
* **Defaults:**
  If the TOML file does not exist, sensible defaults are used and a new file is created on first run.

**Guidelines for Contributors:**

* **Architecture:**
  The project uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for the GUI and a modular, decoupled pipeline for processing. Please follow these patterns when adding new features or refactoring code.
* **Project Structure:**
  - Place new code in the appropriate module within the `goesvfi` package
  - Follow the established directory structure for tests and examples
  - When developing a new feature, consider creating it first as an example script in the appropriate examples directory
* **Utilities:**
  Use the centralized logging (`goesvfi.utils.log`) and configuration (`goesvfi.utils.config`) utilities for all logging and configuration access.
* **Examples and Tests:**
  - When adding new functionality, create appropriate examples in the corresponding `examples/` subdirectory
  - Add unit tests to `tests/unit/`, integration tests to `tests/integration/`, and GUI tests to `tests/gui/`
  - Follow existing patterns for both examples and tests
  - Use the test utilities in `tests/utils/` for common testing functionality
* **Code Style and Pre-commit Hooks:**
  The project uses pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality. **Never skip pre-commit hooks with --no-verify**.
