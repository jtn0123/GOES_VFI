# Summary of Unit Tests for Refactored FileSorter.sort_files

The comprehensive test suite in `test_file_sorter_refactored.py` is designed to validate the functionality of the refactored `FileSorter.sort_files` function and all its helper methods. The test suite is structured as follows:

## Test Organization

1. **TestFileSorterHelpers**: Tests for all the helper functions extracted during the refactoring:
   - Directory validation: `_validate_directories`
   - Cancellation handling: `_check_for_cancellation`
   - Progress tracking: `_update_progress`
   - Date folder validation: `_is_valid_date_folder`
   - Date folder collection: `_collect_date_folders`
   - Datetime extraction: `_get_folder_datetime`
   - Files collection: `_collect_files_to_process`
   - Target path preparation: `_prepare_target_path`
   - File comparison: `_check_files_identical`
   - Duplicate handling: `_handle_duplicate`
   - Single file processing: `_process_single_file`
   - Statistics generation: `_generate_stats`
   - Buffered file copying: `copy_file_with_buffer`

2. **TestFileSorterRefactored**: Integration tests for the complete `sort_files` function:
   - Basic sorting functionality
   - Progress callback usage
   - Cancellation handling
   - Error handling

## Test Coverage

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage for:

1. **Edge cases**:
   - Empty directories
   - Invalid date formats
   - Non-existent source directories
   - Destination that exists as a file instead of a directory
   - Files with identical content and modification times
   - Files with different content but same size
   - Files with same content but different modification times

2. **Duplicate handling**:
   - Skip mode: Tests that existing files are not overwritten
   - Overwrite mode: Tests that existing files are replaced
   - Rename mode: Tests that new numbered versions are created
   - Rename mode with existing numbered files: Tests proper incrementation

3. **Cancellation scenarios**:
   - Cancellation during directory scanning
   - Cancellation during file processing

4. **Error handling**:
   - Errors in directory validation
   - Errors during file processing

5. **Progress reporting**:
   - Correct progress callback invocation for both folder and file processing stages

## Test Fixtures

The test suite reuses the fixtures from the original test file for compatibility:

1. `sorter`: Creates a basic FileSorter instance
2. `sorter_dirs`: Creates temporary directories for testing
3. `create_files`: Populates test directories with realistic folder and file structures

## Key Improvements

Compared to the original tests, this suite adds:

1. Granular testing of each helper function in isolation
2. Clear separation of unit tests from integration tests
3. More comprehensive edge case coverage
4. Testing of newly introduced features like buffered file copying
5. Explicit testing of progress tracking and cancellation callbacks
6. Focus on individual responsibilities of each extracted function

The test suite validates that the refactoring successfully maintained all existing functionality while breaking down the complex `sort_files` function into smaller, more maintainable, and more testable components.
