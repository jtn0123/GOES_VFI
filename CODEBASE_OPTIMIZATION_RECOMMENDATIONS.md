# GOES-VFI Codebase Optimization Recommendations

## Overview
This document contains comprehensive optimization recommendations for the GOES-VFI codebase, focusing on areas **not covered** by the GUI optimization recommendations. These recommendations target core processing, data handling, network operations, and backend architectural improvements.

**Note**: This document complements `GUI_OPTIMIZATION_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` and avoids duplicating GUI-specific optimizations such as update management, preview optimization, and UI threading.

## 1. **Image Processing Pipeline Performance**

### Current Issues
- **Temporary File I/O Bottleneck** (`goesvfi/pipeline/interpolate.py:71-128`)
  - Creates temporary PNG files for every frame pair interpolation
  - Multiple disk I/O operations for each frame processing
  - No in-memory processing pipeline

### Recommendations
- **Priority: HIGH**
- Implement in-memory processing with numpy arrays directly
- Use memory-mapped files for large datasets
- Add image processing cache with LRU eviction
- Implement streaming pipeline to reduce memory footprint

```python
# Example optimization for interpolate.py
class InMemoryRIFEProcessor:
    def __init__(self, cache_size: int = 100):
        self.frame_cache = {}  # LRU cache for processed frames
        
    def interpolate_frames(self, frame1: np.ndarray, frame2: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
        # Process directly in memory without temporary files
        pass
```

## 2. **Memory Management & Resource Optimization**

### Global Download Statistics Issue
- **File**: `goesvfi/integrity_check/remote/s3_store.py`
- **Issue**: Global `DOWNLOAD_STATS` dictionary with unbounded growth (200+ lines of tracking code)
- **Memory Impact**: Statistics accumulate indefinitely, causing memory leaks

### Recommendations
- **Priority: HIGH**
- Create proper `DownloadStatistics` class with automatic cleanup
- Implement size limits and rolling windows for statistics
- Add memory usage monitoring and alerts

```python
class DownloadStatistics:
    def __init__(self, max_history: int = 1000):
        self.max_history = max_history
        self.attempts: deque = deque(maxlen=max_history)
        self.errors: deque = deque(maxlen=100)
        
    def add_attempt(self, success: bool, **kwargs):
        # Bounded collections prevent memory growth
        pass
```

### Object Pool Memory Issues
- **File**: `goesvfi/utils/memory_manager.py:435-450`
- **Issue**: ObjectPool uses basic locks without proper resource limits
- **Problem**: No timeout on acquire operations, potential deadlocks

### Recommendations
- Use `threading.Condition` for proper wait/notify patterns
- Add timeout mechanisms and resource monitoring
- Implement automatic pool cleanup

## 3. **Network & I/O Async Patterns**

### Mixed Async/Sync Patterns
- **File**: `goesvfi/integrity_check/remote/s3_store.py`
- **Issue**: Async S3 operations with synchronous wrappers create inefficiencies
- **Scope**: Backend network operations (not GUI threading)

### Recommendations
- **Priority: MEDIUM**
- Provide clean separation between async and sync APIs for network operations
- Implement proper async context managers for S3 clients
- Use `asyncio.run()` for top-level network coordination

### Backend Process Pool Management
- **Issue**: Multiple backend components create `ProcessPoolExecutor` without coordination
- **Problem**: Can spawn excessive processes for data processing, no global limits
- **Scope**: Data processing operations, not GUI workers

### Recommendations
- Implement global process pool manager for data processing tasks
- Add process monitoring and automatic cleanup for compute-heavy operations
- Use `concurrent.futures` consistently for CPU-bound data tasks

## 4. **Backend Architecture & Duplication**

### Non-GUI Manager Patterns
- **Files**: Data processing managers, configuration managers, validation managers
- **Issue**: Repeated patterns in backend processing components (not GUI managers)
- **Scope**: Core processing logic, data validation, configuration handling

### Recommendations
- **Priority: MEDIUM**
- Create base classes for data processing components
- Implement dependency injection for backend service coordination
- Standardize configuration and validation patterns

```python
class BaseProcessor:
    """Base class for data processing components."""
    
    def __init__(self, config: ProcessingConfig):
        self.config = config
        self._cleanup_hooks = []
        
    def cleanup(self):
        for hook in self._cleanup_hooks:
            hook()
```

### Error Handling Duplication
- **Issue**: Repeated error handling patterns across network operations
- **Files**: S3Store and other remote access components

### Recommendations
- Create error handling decorators for common patterns
- Implement centralized error classification system
- Add automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

## 5. **Modern Python Features**

### Type Annotation Updates
- **Current**: Using `Union` instead of `|` operator
- **Missing**: `Protocol` classes for interfaces, `TypeAlias` for complex types

### Recommendations
- **Priority: LOW**
- Update to Python 3.13 syntax throughout codebase
- Add `Protocol` classes for better interface definitions
- Use `TypeAlias` for complex type definitions

```python
# Modern type hints
from typing import Protocol

class Processor(Protocol):
    def process(self, data: bytes) -> bytes: ...

# Type aliases
ImageArray: TypeAlias = np.ndarray[Any, np.dtype[np.uint8]]
```

### Resource Management Modernization
- **Current**: Manual cleanup, basic context managers
- **Recommended**: Modern context managers, automatic resource tracking

```python
# Example: Temporary directory with proper cleanup
from contextlib import contextmanager
from tempfile import TemporaryDirectory

@contextmanager
def processing_workspace():
    with TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
        yield Path(temp_dir)
        # Automatic cleanup guaranteed
```

## 6. **Performance Bottlenecks**

### Complex Method Refactoring
- **File**: `goesvfi/pipeline/run_vfi.py`
- **Issue**: `VFIProcessor` class handles too many responsibilities (200+ lines)

### Recommendations
- **Priority: HIGH**
- Split into focused classes: `Validator`, `CropHandler`, `ImageProcessor`
- Implement pipeline pattern for processing stages
- Add configuration-driven processing

### Image Loading Optimization
- **File**: `goesvfi/pipeline/image_loader.py:100-112`
- **Issue**: Redundant array operations and type conversions

### Recommendations
- Implement LRU cache for frequently loaded images
- Optimize dtype conversion in single pass
- Add lazy loading for large image sequences

## 7. **Data Structure Optimization**

### Time Series Processing
- **Files**: Integrity check components
- **Issue**: Inefficient timestamp handling and data structures

### Recommendations
- Use pandas for time series operations
- Implement efficient date range queries
- Add caching for computed time ranges

### Configuration Management
- **Issue**: Multiple configuration sources, inconsistent patterns
- **Impact**: Complex startup, difficult to maintain

### Recommendations
- Centralize configuration in single source
- Use Pydantic for configuration validation
- Implement configuration hot-reloading

## 8. **Network & I/O Optimization**

### S3 Client Optimization
- **File**: `goesvfi/integrity_check/remote/s3_store.py:728-928`
- **Issue**: Complex client creation with retry logic mixed into core functionality

### Recommendations
- **Priority: HIGH**
- Separate connection management from business logic
- Implement connection pooling for S3 clients
- Add circuit breaker pattern for network failures

### Backend File I/O Patterns
- **Issue**: Synchronous file operations in data processing components
- **Impact**: Blocks processing threads during large NetCDF/image operations
- **Scope**: Data processing file I/O, not GUI file operations

### Recommendations
- Use `aiofiles` for async file operations in data processing
- Implement file operation queues for batch processing
- Add progress reporting for large file conversions (NetCDF to PNG)
