# CRITICAL: Codebase Issues

## Current State

**The codebase is in a broken state with 79 Python files containing syntax errors.**

This means:
- ❌ Tests cannot run (they appear as "SKIPPED" but are actually failing to import)
- ❌ The application cannot start
- ❌ No modules can be imported
- ❌ The codebase is essentially non-functional

## Test Results Clarification

When the test runner reports:
- **Passed**: 5 files
- **Skipped**: 106 files

What's actually happening:
- **5 files pass** because they don't import any broken modules
- **106 files are NOT skipped** - they FAIL TO IMPORT due to syntax errors

## Root Cause

The codebase has widespread syntax errors including:
- Unmatched parentheses: `)` without opening `(`
- Unexpected indentation
- Invalid syntax in f-strings
- Missing indented blocks after `except` statements
- Invalid decimal literals

## Files Affected

79 out of 118 Python files (67%) have syntax errors, including:
- Core modules: `goesvfi/gui.py`, `goesvfi/run_vfi.py`
- All integrity check modules
- Most pipeline modules
- Most utility modules
- GUI components

## Immediate Action Required

Before ANY other work can proceed:
1. **Fix all 79 files with syntax errors**
2. **Ensure all modules can be imported**
3. **Then re-run tests to see actual pass/fail status**

## Why This Happened

This appears to be the result of:
- Incomplete refactoring operations
- Automated code modifications that broke syntax
- Lack of syntax validation before commits

## Recommendation

The codebase needs emergency repairs before it can be considered for production or even development use. No meaningful testing can occur until these syntax errors are resolved.
