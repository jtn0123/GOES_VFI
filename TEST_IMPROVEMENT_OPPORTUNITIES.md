# Test Improvement Opportunities

## Current Status
- **Total test files**: 111
- **Passing**: 5 files (55 individual tests)
- **Skipped**: 106 files
- **Success rate**: 4.5% of files

## Why Tests Are Skipped

Most tests are being skipped due to:
1. **GUI Dependencies**: PyQt6 tests require display environment
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Some tests need additional packages
3. **Network Dependencies**: S3 tests require mocking or test credentials
4. **File System Dependencies**: Tests expecting specific file structures

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. GUI Test Fixes
```bash
# Run GUI tests with virtual display
sudo apt-get install xvfb  # Linux
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen  # or use Xvfb
```

### 2. Mock External Dependencies
- Mock all S3/boto3 calls
- Mock file system operations
- Mock subprocess calls
- Mock network requests

### 3. Test Environment Setup
```python
# Add to conftest.py
import pytest
import sys
from unittest.mock import MagicMock

# Mock PyQt6 for headless testing
sys.modules['PyQt6'] = MagicMock()
sys.modules['PyQt6.QtCore'] = MagicMock()
sys.modules['PyQt6.QtWidgets'] = MagicMock()
```

### 4. Categorize Tests
```ini
# pytest.ini markers
[pytest]
markers =
    gui: marks tests as requiring GUI (deselect with '-m "not gui"')
    network: marks tests as requiring network
    slow: marks tests as slow
    integration: marks tests as integration tests
```

### 5. Fix Import Issues
Many tests are skipped due to import errors. Common fixes:
- Ensure all test files have proper `__init__.py`
- Add repository root to Python path in tests
- Use absolute imports consistently

### 6. Create Test Fixtures
```python
# tests/fixtures/common.py
@pytest.fixture
def mock_s3_client():
    """Mock S3 client for tests."""
    with patch('boto3.client') as mock:
        yield mock

@pytest.fixture
def temp_workspace(tmp_path):
    """Create temporary workspace with expected structure."""
    (tmp_path / "input").mkdir()
    (tmp_path / "output").mkdir()
    return tmp_path
```

### 7. Test Data Management
- Create minimal test data files
- Use fixtures for common test data
- Mock large file operations
- Use in-memory databases where possible

### 8. Parallel Test Execution
```bash
# Install pytest-xdist
pip install pytest-xdist

# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto
```

### 9. Coverage Integration
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=goesvfi --cov-report=html
```

### 10. Continuous Improvement
1. Start with unit tests (easiest to fix)
2. Move to integration tests
3. Finally tackle GUI tests
4. Add new tests for new features

## Quick Wins

### Enable More Unit Tests
```bash
# Run only unit tests that don't require GUI
pytest tests/unit -m "not gui" -v
```

### Fix Common Import Issues
```python
# Add to each test file
import sys
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))
```

### Mock Heavy Dependencies
```python
# Mock numpy for faster tests
with patch('numpy.array') as mock_array:
    mock_array.return_value = MagicMock()
```

## Priority Order

1. **High Priority**: Fix unit tests (non-GUI)
2. **Medium Priority**: Fix integration tests
3. **Low Priority**: Fix GUI tests (require most setup)

## Expected Outcomes

With these improvements:
- Unit tests: 80%+ passing
- Integration tests: 60%+ passing
- GUI tests: 40%+ passing (with proper environment)
- Overall: 60-70% test suite passing

## Next Steps

1. Create `conftest.py` with common fixtures
2. Add test markers to categorize tests
3. Fix import issues in test files
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Set up CI with proper test environment
6. Gradually increase test coverage

This would significantly improve the test suite's reliability and make it easier to maintain code quality going forward.
