## Implementation Progress

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - Critical Production Issues

#### 1. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
**Status**: ✅ Completed (2024-12-06)
**Description**: Implement retry logic for S3/CDN failures with exponential backoff.
**Exponential Backoff Explained**: This is a retry strategy where the wait time between retries increases exponentially. For example:
- 1st retry: Wait 1-1.3 seconds (1s + 0-30% jitter)
- 2nd retry: Wait 2-2.6 seconds (2s + 0-30% jitter)
- 3rd retry: Wait 4-5.2 seconds (4s + 0-30% jitter)
- This prevents overwhelming the server and gives temporary issues time to resolve.

**Implementation Details**:
- Created `retry_with_exponential_backoff` decorator in s3_store.py
- Configurable parameters: max_retries (3), initial_backoff (1s), multiplier (2x), max_backoff (30s)
- Added jitter (0-30% of backoff time) to prevent thundering herd
- Non-retryable errors: AccessDenied, 403, NoSuchKey, 404, NoSuchBucket
- Retryable errors: ClientError, TimeoutError, ConnectionError, socket.timeout, OSError
- Integrated with download operations for both exact and wildcard matches
- Updates retry statistics in DOWNLOAD_STATS

**Tasks**:
- [x] Add retry decorator with configurable attempts
- [x] Implement exponential backoff algorithm
- [x] Add jitter to prevent thundering herd
- [x] Add max retry timeout
- [x] Log retry attempts for monitoring

**Status**: ✅ Completed (2024-12-06)

1. Primary: NOAA S3 bucket (fastest)
2. Secondary: NOAA CDN (slower but more reliable)
3. Tertiary: Local cache if available (placeholder for future)
4. If all fail: Provide clear guidance on manual download options

**Implementation Details**:
