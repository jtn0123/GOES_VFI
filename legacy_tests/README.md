# Legacy Tests

This directory contains test files that may be redundant or superseded by newer tests. 
These files are preserved for evaluation - they may be updated and moved to proper test directories,
converted to examples, or removed in the future.

## Evaluation Criteria

For each file in this directory, consider:

1. **Is the test still relevant?** Does it test functionality that's still part of the application?
2. **Is the test redundant?** Is its functionality already covered by another test?
3. **Is the test valuable as an example?** Should it be moved to the examples directory?
4. **Is the test valuable but needs updating?** Should it be modernized and moved to a proper test directory?
5. **Should the test be removed?** Is it outdated and no longer useful?
