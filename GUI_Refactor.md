# GUI.py Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the refactoring of `goesvfi/gui.py` from a monolithic 3,900-line file into a modular, maintainable architecture with proper separation of concerns.

## Current State Analysis

### File Metrics
- **Total Lines**: 3,903
- **Classes**: 1 (MainWindow)
- **Methods**: 43
- **Complexity Issues**:
  - `saveSettings()` (line 1500): F-grade complexity
  - `_load_process_scale_preview()` (line 2568): F-grade complexity
  - `loadSettings()` (line 1180): E-grade complexity

### Identified Functional Areas
1. **Initialization & Setup** (lines 103-481)
2. **Settings Management** (lines 545-627, 1180-1499, 2252-2495)
3. **State Management** (lines 628-818)
4. **File/Directory Operations** (lines 819-851)
5. **Image Cropping** (lines 852-1004)

9. **UI State Management** (lines 3136-3276)
10. **Theme & Styling** (lines 3588-3862)

### Dependencies
- 13 test files currently import MainWindow
- Key shared components: view models, settings, image processors
- Complex signal connections between functional areas

## Refactoring Architecture

### New Module Structure
```
goesvfi/
├── gui.py (refactored to ~500 lines)
└── gui_components/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── settings_manager.py
    ├── preview_manager.py
    ├── processing_controller.py
    ├── model_manager.py
    ├── state_manager.py
    ├── file_operations.py
    ├── ui_state_controller.py
    └── legacy_adapter.py
```

### File Size Guidelines
**Target**: Keep component files manageable and focused
- **Ideal Size**: 200-400 lines per file
- **Maximum Size**: ~600 lines (soft limit)
- **Minimum Size**: ~100 lines (avoid over-fragmentation)

**Rationale**:
- Files under 400 lines are easier to understand at a glance
- Multiple smaller files enable parallel development
- Focused files have clearer test boundaries
- Easier to maintain complexity grades

**Status**: Completed

**Analysis Results**:
- Project already uses MVVM pattern with ViewModels for state management
- MainWindowViewModel coordinates child ViewModels
- PyQt signals provide reactive state updates
- Creating new StateManager would be redundant

**State Variables Migrated**:
From `gui.py` to ViewModels:
- [x] `self.in_dir` → ProcessingViewModel.input_directory
- [x] `self.out_file_path` → ProcessingViewModel.output_file_path
- [x] `self.current_crop_rect` → ProcessingViewModel.crop_rect
- [x] `self.is_processing` → Already in ProcessingViewModel
- [x] `self.current_encoder` → ProcessingViewModel.current_encoder
- [x] `self.current_model_key` → Already managed by ModelManager

**Implementation**:
- Added state properties to ProcessingViewModel
- Created property delegates in gui.py for backward compatibility
- All state now managed by appropriate ViewModels
- Zero regression - all 13 MainWindow tests passing

**Results**:
- State management centralized in ViewModels
- Clean separation of concerns maintained
- Backward compatibility preserved
- No new files needed - leveraged existing infrastructure

#### 3.2 FileOperations ✅

- [x] `_set_in_dir_from_sorter()` → `handle_sorter_directory()`

**New File**: `goesvfi/gui_components/file_operations.py`
**Actual Lines**: 82 (well under estimate)
**Complexity**: A grade achieved

**Results**:
- Created clean FileOperations component with single responsibility
- All methods now delegate to FileOperations for file/directory selection
- Improved testability and reduced coupling
- Added validation for sorter directories

### Phase 4: UI State Controller ✅

#### 4.1 UI State Delegation ✅
**Target Completion**: 2025-06-24
**Status**: Completed

**Analysis Results**:
- MainTab already has comprehensive UI state management methods
- No need for separate UIStateController - delegation is the correct approach

**Methods Refactored**:
- [x] `_update_start_button_state()` → Delegates to MainTab (D→A grade)
- [x] `_set_processing_state()` → Delegates to MainTab (C→A grade)
- [x] `_update_previews()` → Extracted helper methods (D→B grade)
- [x] `_on_crop_clicked()` → Extracted preparation logic (D→B grade)

**Results**:

## Risk Log

### Identified Risks
1. **Signal Connection Complexity**: Complex Qt signal connections may be difficult to refactor
   - *Mitigation*: Map all signals before refactoring

2. **Test Breakage**: Existing tests heavily coupled to MainWindow implementation
   - *Mitigation*: Use legacy adapter pattern

3. **State Synchronization**: Multiple components need synchronized state
   - *Mitigation*: Centralized state manager with observer pattern

## Code Review Checklist

### For Each New Component:
- [ ] Complexity grade C or better (verified with Xenon)
- [ ] Type hints on all methods
- [ ] Docstrings on all public methods
- [ ] Unit tests with >90% coverage
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Passes all linters (flake8, mypy, black)
- [ ] Error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Logging at appropriate levels

## Integration with Existing Components

### Leverage Existing Infrastructure
The project already has modular components that should be reused:

1. **View Models** (`goesvfi/view_models/`)
   - Keep using `MainWindowViewModel` and `ProcessingViewModel`
   - New components should communicate through view models

2. **Utils** (`goesvfi/utils/`)
   - Reuse existing validation, settings, and error handling utilities
   - Avoid duplicating functionality

3. **Pipeline Components** (`goesvfi/pipeline/`)
   - Keep using existing processors (ImageLoader, SanchezProcessor, etc.)
   - New components should wrap, not replace these

### Naming Conventions
- **Managers**: Handle business logic and coordination (e.g., SettingsManager)
- **Controllers**: Handle UI flow and user interactions (e.g., ProcessingController)
- **Adapters**: Bridge between old and new interfaces (e.g., LegacyAdapter)

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Signal Management
Create a central signal broker to manage Qt signals:
```python
# goesvfi/gui_components/signal_broker.py
class SignalBroker:
    """Centralize signal management to reduce coupling"""
```

### 2. Configuration Objects
Replace long parameter lists with configuration objects:
```python
# goesvfi/gui_components/types.py
@dataclass
class ProcessingConfig:
    input_path: Path
    output_path: Path
    fps: int
    # ... other settings
```

### 3. Error Handling Strategy
- Create custom exceptions for each component
- Use error boundaries at component interfaces
- Log errors with component context

### 4. Progressive Migration
1. Start with read-only operations (settings loading)
2. Move to stateless operations (file selection)
3. Finally tackle stateful operations (processing)

### 5. Testing Strategy Additions
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Snapshot Tests**: For UI state validation
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure no regression in startup time

## Notes and Decisions

### Design Decisions:
- Using dependency injection for testability
- Observer pattern for state management
- Facade pattern for MainWindow simplification
- Strategy pattern for different processing modes
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Technical Debt to Address:
- Remove direct widget access from business logic
- Eliminate tight coupling between settings and UI
- Improve error handling granularity
- Add proper cancellation support
- Standardize logging patterns across components

### Code Style Guidelines for New Components:
- Use type hints extensively
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- One class per file (with exceptions for small helper classes)
- Docstrings on all public methods
- Private methods start with underscore

## Next Steps
1. Begin with SettingsManager extraction (lowest risk)
2. Set up gui_components package structure
3. Create first unit tests for SettingsManager
4. Implement legacy adapter pattern

## Summary of Updates (Latest Pass)

### Added in This Update:
1. **File Size Guidelines**:
   - Ideal: 200-400 lines
   - Maximum: ~600 lines (soft limit)
   - Method length targets: 40-50 lines max

2. **Integration Strategy**:
   - Leverage existing view models and utilities
   - Avoid duplicating existing functionality
   - Clear naming conventions for component types

3. **Additional Recommendations**:
   - Signal broker pattern for Qt signal management
   - Configuration objects to replace long parameter lists
   - Progressive migration strategy
   - Extended testing strategies (integration, snapshot, performance)

4. **Code Style Guidelines**:
   - Explicit type hints
   - One class per file principle
   - Comprehensive docstrings
   - Private method naming convention

### Key Principles:
- **Modularity**: Each component has a single, clear responsibility
- **Testability**: All components designed for easy unit testing
- **Maintainability**: File sizes and complexity kept manageable
- **Reusability**: Components can be used in other contexts
- **Progressive**: Can be implemented incrementally without breaking existing code

## Implementation Notes

   - F-grade methods: 3 → 0 ✅
   - E-grade methods: 0 → 0 ✅
   - D-grade methods: 4 → 0 ✅
   - C-grade methods: 9 → 4 ✅ (achieved target of <5)

2. **Completed multiple refactoring phases**:
   - Phase 1.1: SettingsManager extraction ✅
   - Phase 1.2: PreviewManager extraction ✅
   - Phase 2.1: ProcessingController extraction ✅
   - Phase 2.2: ModelManager integration ✅
   - Phase 3.1: State Management migration ✅
   - Phase 3.2: FileOperations creation ✅
   - Phase 4: UI State Controller delegation ✅

3. **Created/Integrated components**:
   - FileOperations (new - 82 lines)
   - CropManager (integrated existing)
   - Total: 12 modular components

4. **Code reduction**:
   - Removed 165 lines of dead code (_start method)
   - Reduced total lines: 3,903 → 3,643 (260 lines removed)
   - Refactored 18 methods total

5. **Complexity improvements**:
   - `saveSettings()`: F-grade → A-grade
   - `loadSettings()`: E-grade → A-grade
   - `_load_process_scale_preview()`: F-grade → A-grade
   - `_load_all_settings()`: D-grade → B-grade
   - `_clear_preview_labels()`: C-grade → A-grade
   - `set_crop_rect()`: C-grade → B-grade
   - `_save_all_settings()`: C-grade → B-grade
   - `set_in_dir()`: C-grade → B-grade

#### Remaining C-grade methods (4):
- `_update_rife_ui_elements` - UI update logic
- `closeEvent` - cleanup on window close
- `_handle_process_error` - error handling
- `_check_settings_match_profile` - settings validation

#### Next Steps:
1. Remove ~1,500 lines of commented legacy code
2. Move `_check_settings_match_profile` to FFmpegSettingsTab
3. Continue extracting components to reach <500 lines goal
4. Update tests for new component architecture
5. Add comprehensive component tests

#### Key Success Factors:
- Leveraged existing refactored components instead of creating new ones
- Used delegation pattern extensively
- Maintained backward compatibility throughout
- Extracted helper methods to reduce complexity
- Followed clean architecture principles
