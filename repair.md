# GOES_VFI Repository Repair Log

## Summary
The GOES_VFI repository has 197 files with systematic corruption patterns. This document tracks the repair process.

## Corruption Patterns Identified
1. **Shebang line corruption**: Extra spaces in `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
2. **Import order issues**: `__future__` imports not at the top of files
3. **Joined lines**: Multiple lines collapsed together
4. **Indentation issues**: Missing indentation after class definitions
5. **Multiline import formatting**: Split imports incorrectly formatted
6. **Docstring/import mixing**: Imports placed inside docstrings
7. **Syntax errors**: Mismatched parentheses, incorrect function calls

## Repair Strategy
Phase 1: Fix core import chain files to get app to launch
Phase 2: Fix core functionality files
Phase 3: Fix GUI enhancement files
Phase 4: Fix utility files
