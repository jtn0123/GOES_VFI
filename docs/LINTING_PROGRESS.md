# Linting Progress Report

## Current Status

Pre-commit hooks and GitHub Actions workflows have been set up for automated linting and code quality checks. The initial run of pre-commit tools identified and fixed many formatting issues across the codebase.

## Priority Issues to Address

1. **Critical Syntax Errors**:
   - Fixed missing parentheses in `goesvfi/gui.py` that were causing syntax errors
   - Need to systematically review other files for similar syntax issues

2. **Whitespace and Formatting**:
   - Trailing whitespace has been fixed in many files via pre-commit
   - Code has been formatted with Black for consistent style
   - Import organization with isort is partially complete

3. **Logging Practices**:
   - F-string logging needs to be replaced with more efficient %-style logging
   - Many files still use inefficient patterns like `LOGGER.info(f"message {var}")`

4. **Type Annotations**:
   - Several files need more consistent type annotations
   - Generic type parameters need to be added where missing

## Files with Major Improvements

1. **goesvfi/integrity_check/background_worker.py**:
   - Removed unused imports
   - Replaced f-string logging with %-style logging
   - Fixed indentation in parameter lists
   - Improved docstrings and code organization

2. **goesvfi/integrity_check/time_index.py**:
   - Fixed trailing whitespace and docstring formatting
   - Restructured complex functions for better readability
   - Added proper blank lines between functions
   - Fixed formatting of long parameter lists
   - Improved error handling with proper exception chaining

3. **goesvfi/integrity_check/reconciler.py**:
   - Removed unused imports
   - Fixed indentation in method calls
   - Improved spacing consistency

4. **goesvfi/integrity_check/remote_store.py**:
   - Replaced f-string logging with more efficient %-style logging
   - Improved error handling and code structure
   - Fixed unnecessary elif after return statements

## Next Steps

1. **Critical Issues**:
   - Fix any remaining syntax errors in the codebase
   - Ensure all files have proper closing parentheses and brackets

2. **High Priority**:
   - Address remaining f-string logging issues across the codebase
   - Fix unused imports in core modules
   - Address line length issues in complex functions

3. **Medium Priority**:
   - Improve type annotations in core modules
   - Clean up redundant code in larger functions
   - Fix `elif` after `return` patterns for better control flow

4. **Testing**:
   - Run the application to verify fixes don't introduce new issues
   - Run test suite to ensure code remains functional
