# Linting Progress Report

## Files Improved

### goesvfi/integrity_check/auto_detection.py

**Initial Issues:**
- Trailing whitespace throughout the file
- Inconsistent spacing after docstrings
- Missing blank lines between method definitions
- Line length violations in several places
- Unnecessary whitespace in method definitions

**Fixes Applied:**
- Removed trailing whitespace across the entire file
- Fixed inconsistent spacing in method definitions
- Added proper blank lines between class methods
- Ensured consistent spacing in docstrings
- Fixed line formatting in lengthy method signatures:
  ```python
  # Before
  def detect_interval(self, directory: Path, timestamps: Optional[List[datetime]] = None, 
      satellite: SatellitePattern = SatellitePattern.GENERIC
  ) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
  
  # After
  def detect_interval(
      self, directory: Path, timestamps: Optional[List[datetime]] = None,
      satellite: SatellitePattern = SatellitePattern.GENERIC
  ) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
  ```
- Fixed string formatting in long messages:
  ```python
  # Before
  self.progress.emit(20, f"Found {len(png_files)} PNG files, {len(nc_files)} NetCDF files, {len(jpg_files)} JPG files", "info")
  
  # After
  self.progress.emit(
      20,
      (
          f"Found {len(png_files)} PNG files, {len(nc_files)} NetCDF files, "
          f"{len(jpg_files)} JPG files"
      ),
      "info"
  )
  ```

**Style Improvements:**
- Removed unnecessary `pass` statement from exception class
- Fixed whitespace after method definitions
- Fixed indentation in method parameters
- Added proper newline at end of file
- Removed extra whitespace between class methods

### goesvfi/integrity_check/time_index.py

**Initial Issues:**
- Trailing whitespace in docstrings and method definitions
- Inconsistent spacing between functions and docstrings
- Inconsistent line spacing in complex functions
- Line length violations (B950) in several places
- Missing blank lines between function definitions (E302)
- Unnecessarily complex code structure in several functions (C901)

**Fixes Applied:**
- Removed trailing whitespace from docstrings
- Fixed inconsistent spacing in method definitions
- Fixed line spacing in long docstrings with multiple sections
- Ensured consistent whitespace in complex datetime handling code
- Reformatted function parameters for better readability:
  ```python
  # Before
  def to_s3_key(ts: datetime, satellite: SatellitePattern, product_type: str = "RadC",
               band: int = 13, exact_match: bool = False) -> str:

  # After
  def to_s3_key(
      ts: datetime,
      satellite: SatellitePattern,
      product_type: str = "RadC",
      band: int = 13,
      exact_match: bool = False
  ) -> str:
  ```
- Fixed line length issues by breaking long f-strings into multiline strings:
  ```python
  # Before
  pattern = f"OR_ABI-L1b-{product_type}-M6C{band_str}_{sat_code}_s{year}{doy_str}{hour}{minute_str}{start_sec:02d}_e*_c*.nc"

  # After
  pattern = (
      f"OR_ABI-L1b-{product_type}-M6C{band_str}_{sat_code}_s"
      f"{year}{doy_str}{hour}{minute_str}{start_sec:02d}_e*_c*.nc"
  )
  ```
- Added proper blank lines between function definitions

**Style Improvements:**
- Ensured consistent spacing between class methods
- Removed redundant whitespace at the end of lines
- Fixed indentation in multi-line statements
- Made docstring formatting consistent across the file
- Split long comments into multiple lines to improve readability
- Fixed exception handling to use proper chaining: `raise ... from err`
- Added two blank lines between functions consistently

### goesvfi/integrity_check/reconciler.py

**Initial Issues:**
- Unused imports (datetime.timedelta, typing.Set, typing.Tuple, typing.Union)
- Reference to unused import (extract_timestamp)
- Trailing whitespace in docstrings
- Inconsistent indentation in method calls
- Unnecessary list conversion in sorted() call

**Fixes Applied:**
- Removed unused imports
- Fixed trailing whitespace in docstrings
- Fixed indentation in method calls and parameters
- Replaced `sorted(list(missing_set))` with `sorted(missing_set)`
- Added proper spacing between operators: `i-1` to `i - 1`
- Added proper newline at end of file

**Style Improvements:**
- Consistent docstring formatting
- Proper spacing between method definitions
- Proper spacing after commas

### goesvfi/integrity_check/background_worker.py

**Initial Issues:**
- Unused imports (typing.List, typing.Tuple, typing.Union, ThreadPoolExecutor, Future, QThread, QApplication)
- Inconsistent indentation in method signatures and parameters
- F-string logging issues (inefficient when used with logging module)
- Missing newline at end of file
- Trailing whitespace throughout file

**Fixes Applied:**
- Removed unused imports and replaced with comments for clarity:
  ```python
  # Before
  from typing import Dict, Any, List, Optional, Tuple, Union, Callable, TypeVar, Generic
  from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, Future
  from PyQt6.QtCore import QObject, pyqtSignal, QTimer, QThread, QRunnable, QThreadPool
  from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication

  # After
  from typing import Dict, Any, Optional, Callable, TypeVar, Generic
  # Concurrent futures for thread management
  from PyQt6.QtCore import QObject, pyqtSignal, QTimer, QRunnable, QThreadPool
  # PyQt widgets for UI integration
  ```
- Fixed indentation in method signatures:
  ```python
  # Before
  def __init__(self, task_id: str, func: Callable[..., T],
              *args, **kwargs) -> None:

  # After
  def __init__(self, task_id: str, func: Callable[..., T],
               *args, **kwargs) -> None:
  ```
- Replaced f-string logging with more efficient %-style logging:
  ```python
  # Before
  LOGGER.error(f"Task {self.task_id} failed: {e}\n{error_traceback}")

  # After
  LOGGER.error("Task %s failed: %s\n%s", self.task_id, e, error_traceback)
  ```
- Added newline at end of file
- Fixed over-indentation in error handling code

**Style Improvements:**
- Proper indentation in parameter lists for better readability
- More efficient logging practices
- Cleaner import management
- Consistent spacing in method signatures

### Priorities for Remaining Files

Based on the linting results, the highest-priority issues to fix are:

1. **Unused imports and undefined names (F4xx errors)**: These can indicate actual bugs or inefficiencies
2. **Exception handling (B9xx errors)**: Use proper exception chaining with `raise ... from err`
3. **Line length issues (E501/B950)**: Fix lines that exceed length limits by reformatting
4. **Method complexity (C901)**: Functions that are too complex should be refactored
5. **Blank line and whitespace issues (W2xx)**: Fix for better readability

## Linting Score Improvements

| File | Initial Score | Current Score | Improvement |
|------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| goesvfi/integrity_check/auto_detection.py | 5.92/10 | 6.88/10 | +0.96 |
| goesvfi/integrity_check/time_index.py | 6.65/10 | 7.78/10 | +1.13 |
| goesvfi/integrity_check/reconciler.py | 6.92/10 | 7.54/10 | +0.62 |
| goesvfi/integrity_check/background_worker.py | 4.93/10 | 6.33/10 | +1.40 |

## Next Steps

1. Address trailing whitespace issues (C0303) across files - while these are lower priority, they're easy to fix
2. Fix line length issues (C0301/B950) in other files using the same techniques as above
3. Address unnecessary `elif` after `return` issues (R1705) for improved code structure
4. Address logging f-string interpolation issues (W1203) by using %.format() style
5. Tackle complex function issues (C901) by considering refactoring some functions
6. Continue improving other files in the codebase following the same approach
