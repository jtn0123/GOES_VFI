# Linting Progress Report

## Files Improved

### goesvfi/integrity_check/auto_detection.py

**Initial Issues:**
- Trailing whitespace throughout the file
- Inconsistent spacing after docstrings
- Missing blank lines between method definitions
- Line length violations in several places
- Unnecessary whitespace in method definitions

**Fixes Applied:**
- Removed trailing whitespace across the entire file
- Fixed inconsistent spacing in method definitions
- Added proper blank lines between class methods
- Ensured consistent spacing in docstrings
- Fixed line formatting in lengthy method signatures:
  ```python
  # Before
  def detect_interval(self, directory: Path, timestamps: Optional[List[datetime]] = None, 
      satellite: SatellitePattern = SatellitePattern.GENERIC
  ) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
  
  # After
  def detect_interval(
      self, directory: Path, timestamps: Optional[List[datetime]] = None,
      satellite: SatellitePattern = SatellitePattern.GENERIC
  ) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
  ```
- Fixed string formatting in long messages:
  ```python
  # Before
  self.progress.emit(20, f"Found {len(png_files)} PNG files, {len(nc_files)} NetCDF files, {len(jpg_files)} JPG files", "info")
  
  # After
  self.progress.emit(
      20,
      (
          f"Found {len(png_files)} PNG files, {len(nc_files)} NetCDF files, "
          f"{len(jpg_files)} JPG files"
      ),
      "info"
  )
  ```

**Style Improvements:**
- Removed unnecessary `pass` statement from exception class
- Fixed whitespace after method definitions
- Fixed indentation in method parameters
- Added proper newline at end of file
- Removed extra whitespace between class methods

### goesvfi/integrity_check/time_index.py

**Initial Issues:**
- Trailing whitespace in docstrings and method definitions
- Inconsistent spacing between functions and docstrings
- Inconsistent line spacing in complex functions

**Fixes Applied:**
- Removed trailing whitespace from docstrings
- Fixed inconsistent spacing in method definitions
- Fixed line spacing in long docstrings with multiple sections
- Ensured consistent whitespace in complex datetime handling code
- Fixed multiline function parameter formatting

**Style Improvements:**
- Ensured consistent spacing between class methods
- Removed redundant whitespace at the end of lines
- Fixed indentation in multi-line statements
- Made docstring formatting consistent across the file

## Next Steps

1. Run full linter command with flake8 and pylint to check for any remaining issues
2. Continue with other high-priority files in the codebase
3. Focus on remaining whitespace issues in other files
4. Address any code complexity issues flagged by pylint
