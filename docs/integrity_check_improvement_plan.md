2. **Directory Selection**:
   - **Current**: Each tab has its own directory selection logic
   - **Plan**: Create a unified `DirectorySelector` component with shared state

3. **Timeline Visualization**:
   - **Current**: Different implementations in `timeline_visualization.py` and `enhanced_timeline.py`
   - **Plan**: Consolidate into a single component with extended capabilities

4. **Data Models**:
   - **Current**: Multiple models for handling missing timestamps
   - **Plan**: Create a unified data model shared across tabs

5. **View Functions**:
   - **Current**: Duplicate code for displaying items, timestamps, etc.
   - **Plan**: Extract common display logic into shared components

### Phase 3: Testing and Documentation

#### 1. Comprehensive Testing
- [ ] Run all unit tests to ensure components work individually
- [ ] Run integration tests to ensure components work together
- [ ] Perform manual testing of user workflows

#### 2. Documentation
- [ ] Document tab relationships and data flow
- [ ] Update user documentation to reflect new features and workflows
- [ ] Create developer documentation for the integrated tab system

## Performance Optimizations

Based on the performance analysis results, we have implemented several optimizations:

1. **Lazy Loading**:

   - Only load tab data when tab is first displayed
   - Cache results to avoid redundant loading

2. **Background Processing**:
   - Moved heavy operations to background threads
   - Added progress reporting for long-running operations
   - Implemented cancellation support for background tasks

3. **UI Freeze Prevention**:
   - Added UIFreezeMonitor to detect and log UI freezes

   - Added yielding points in long loops to keep UI responsive

4. **Memory Optimization**:
   - Implemented item virtualization for large tree views
   - Added memory usage monitoring and garbage collection
   - Optimized thumbnail rendering to reduce memory consumption

## Identified Issues

### Current Issues

1. **Tab Synchronization Issues**: 
   - ✅ Date range auto-detection not propagating to all tabs
   - ✅ Directory selection not consistently updating all tabs
   - ✅ Scan results not always appearing in Timeline and Results tabs

2. **UI Inconsistencies**:
   - Font issues causing warnings ("Monospace" font warnings)
   - Inconsistent styling between tabs
   - Layout issues in some UI components

3. **Feature Gaps**:
   - ✅ Limited feedback during operations
   - ✅ Incomplete error handling in some scenarios
   - ✅ Missing cross-tab navigation

## Performance Analysis Results

### Timeline Tab
- Large dataset loading (1000+ items) takes 0.3-0.5 seconds
- Memory usage increases with dataset size at approx. 0.1MB per 100 items
- UI may become unresponsive during initial rendering of large datasets

### Results Tab
- Tree view grouping operations are expensive, especially "Day" and "Hour" grouping
- Memory usage spikes during group changes
- "Status" grouping is most efficient in terms of both time and memory

### Tab Switching
- Switching to the Results tab is the most expensive operation
- First switch to any tab takes longer than subsequent switches
- Full cycle through all tabs can cause temporary UI freezes

### UI Responsiveness
- Mouse events may be delayed during heavy data loading
- Memory usage increases significantly during rapid tab switching
- Some UI operations block the main thread, causing unresponsiveness
