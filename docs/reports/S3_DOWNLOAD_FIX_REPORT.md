# GOES_VFI Application Crash Fix Report

## Issue Summary

The GOES_VFI application was crashing during video processing with the following error:

```
NotImplementedError: ImageLoader does not implement the save method.
```

The error occurred in the `run_vfi.py` module when attempting to process satellite imagery. The root cause was determined to be the improper use of an `ImageLoader` instance to perform image saving operations, which is not supported by this class.

## Investigation and Analysis

Analyzing the crash logs and source code, we identified the following specific issues:

1. `ImageLoader` was being incorrectly used in the `_process_single_image_worker` function to save processed images, but `ImageLoader` does not implement the `save` method (it only handles loading).

2. An `ImageSaver` class was available in the codebase but wasn't being instantiated and used at the right place in the processing pipeline.

3. While the `run_vfi.py` script correctly defined the argument position for `image_saver` in function signatures, it was instantiating an `ImageLoader` object and passing it to functions that expected an object with a `save` method, causing the runtime error.

## Solution Implemented

The fix implemented was straightforward:

1. Created an `ImageSaver` instance early in the processing pipeline, alongside the other image processing objects.

2. Modified the image processing pipeline to use this instance for all save operations, removing the redundant creation of an `ImageSaver` in the first image processing step.

3. Ensured all other uses of the image processors (in parallel processing threads) were correctly referencing the `ImageSaver` instance.

The implemented solution preserves the overall architecture and design of the image processing pipeline, while resolving the runtime error by using the appropriate implementations for each step (loading, processing, saving) of the image pipeline.

## Files Modified

- `/Users/justin/Documents/Github/GOES_VFI/goesvfi/pipeline/run_vfi.py`
  - Added creation of an `ImageSaver` instance alongside other image processors
  - Removed duplicate `ImageSaver` creation in the first image processing step

## Testing

The fix was tested by running the application with the sample satellite imagery, confirming that:

1. The application successfully loads and processes satellite imagery
2. The "NotImplementedError" no longer occurs
3. The image processing pipeline works as expected, from loading to saving processed images

## Future Recommendations

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Consider adding clearer type annotations to function parameters that expect specific interfaces
2. Add runtime assertion checks to verify processor interfaces before using their methods
3. Consider refactoring the image processing pipeline to use a factory pattern or dependency injection to ensure correct processor instances are always used for the appropriate operations
