# GOES VFI Integrity Check Enhancements Report

## Overview

This report documents the comprehensive UI enhancements made to the GOES VFI application's Integrity Check tab, focusing on improving user experience, functionality, and performance for satellite imagery management.

## 1. Image Processing Pipeline Fix

### Issue Description

The application would crash when attempting to process images with the following error:

```
NotImplementedError: ImageLoader does not implement the save method.
```

The crash occurred in the `run_vfi.py` module when attempting to save processed images using an `ImageLoader` instance, which doesn't support saving operations.

### Solution Implemented

1. Properly instantiated the `ImageSaver` class alongside other image processing components
2. Modified the code to use the `ImageSaver` instance for all save operations
3. Removed duplicate instantiation of `ImageSaver` in the first image processing step

### Files Modified

- `/Users/justin/Documents/Github/GOES_VFI/goesvfi/pipeline/run_vfi.py`

### Testing Results

The application now successfully starts and processes images without crashing. The image processing pipeline correctly uses the appropriate classes for each operation:
- `ImageLoader` for loading images
- `SanchezProcessor` for image processing
- `ImageCropper` for cropping images
- `ImageSaver` for saving images

## 2. Integrity Check UI Enhancements

### Advanced Configuration Options

A new dialog allows users to configure various aspects of the integrity check process:

#### Connection Options
- **Connection Timeout**: Configure the timeout for S3/CDN connections (30-300 seconds)
- **Max Concurrent Downloads**: Set the maximum number of concurrent downloads (1-20)
- **Auto-retry Attempts**: Number of times to automatically retry failed downloads (0-5)

#### Performance Options
- **Network Throttling**: Limit download speed to reduce impact on your network
- **Max Download Speed**: Maximum download speed per file (100-10000 KB/s)
- **Process Priority**: Set the priority for download operations (Low, Normal, High)

#### Image Processing Options
- **Auto-enhance Images**: Automatically enhance downloaded images for better visibility
- **Apply False Color**: Apply false coloring to IR images for better visualization
- **Auto-convert NetCDF**: Automatically convert NetCDF files to PNG after download

#### Notification Options
- **Desktop Notifications**: Show desktop notifications when operations complete
- **Sound Alerts**: Play sound when operations complete or errors occur

### Batch Operations

A new dialog enables users to perform operations on multiple files at once:

#### Operations
- **Download Selected Files**: Download selected missing files
- **Retry Failed Downloads**: Retry files that failed to download
- **Export Selected Items to CSV**: Export a list of selected items to a CSV file
- **Delete Selected Files**: Delete selected files from disk

#### Filters
- **All Items**: Apply operation to all items
- **Selected Items Only**: Apply operation only to items selected in the table
- **Failed Downloads Only**: Apply operation only to items that failed to download
- **Missing Files Only**: Apply operation only to files that are missing
- **Downloaded Files Only**: Apply operation only to files that are downloaded

### Network Diagnostics

A comprehensive diagnostic tool provides detailed information about S3/CDN downloads:

- **System Information**: Hostname, session ID, start time
- **Download Statistics**: Total attempts, successful, failed, retry count, success rate, average download time, total data transferred
- **Error Statistics**: Not found errors, auth errors, timeouts, network errors
- **Recent Errors**: List of recent errors with type, message, and timestamp

### Visualization Options

A new dialog allows customizing how images and data are displayed:

#### Image Display
- **Color Scheme**: Choose from different color schemes for displaying images
- **Auto-enhance Images**: Automatically enhance images for better visibility
- **Apply False Color**: Apply false coloring to IR images

#### Preview Settings
- **Preview Size**: Choose the size of preview images
- **Show Previews**: Enable/disable preview images

#### Table Display
- **Timestamp Format**: Choose how timestamps are displayed in the table
- **Show File Paths**: Enable/disable displaying file paths in the table

### Configuration Management

New functionality for managing user settings:

- **Save Current Configuration**: Save the current configuration to a JSON file
- **Load Configuration**: Load configuration from a JSON file
- **Reset to Defaults**: Reset all settings to their default values

## Implementation Details

### New Dialog Classes Added
- `AdvancedOptionsDialog`: For configuring advanced options
- `BatchOperationsDialog`: For performing batch operations on multiple files
- Enhanced visual styling for dark mode compatibility

### New UI Elements
- Advanced options dropdown menu
- Network diagnostics reporting with HTML output
- Visualization options panel
- Configuration management tools

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Improved error reporting in the UI
- Added detailed network diagnostics for troubleshooting
- Better user feedback for failed operations

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files
- `/Users/justin/Documents/Github/GOES_VFI/docs/integrity_check_enhanced_options.md`: Comprehensive documentation of new features

### Modified Files
- `/Users/justin/Documents/Github/GOES_VFI/goesvfi/integrity_check/enhanced_gui_tab.py`: Added new dialogs and functionality
- `/Users/justin/Documents/Github/GOES_VFI/UI_ENHANCEMENTS.md`: Updated with completed enhancements

## Testing Results

The enhanced integrity check tab was thoroughly tested and works as expected:
- All new dialogs display correctly and are functional
- Batch operations successfully process multiple files
- Network diagnostics accurately report download statistics
- Configuration settings are properly saved, loaded, and reset
- The UI remains responsive during operations

## Benefits for Users

These enhancements provide significant benefits to users:

1. **Improved Efficiency**: Batch operations save time when working with large datasets
2. **Better Control**: Advanced options give users fine-grained control over performance
3. **Enhanced Troubleshooting**: Network diagnostics help identify and resolve download issues
4. **Customization**: Visualization options adapt to user preferences
5. **Consistency**: Configuration management ensures settings persistence

## Conclusion

The enhancements made to the Integrity Check tab significantly improve its functionality and user experience. The application now provides advanced features for satellite imagery management, better performance optimization options, and improved error handling.

These improvements make the GOES VFI application more powerful, flexible, and user-friendly for working with GOES satellite imagery.

## Future Recommendations

1. Implement a timeline visualization for satellite imagery availability
2. Add preview capabilities directly in the integrity check tab
3. Create automated download scheduling based on time patterns
4. Implement additional visualization options for different satellite bands
5. Add support for more satellites beyond GOES-16 and GOES-18
