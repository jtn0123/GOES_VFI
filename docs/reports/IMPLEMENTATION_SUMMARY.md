# Implementation Summary

## Timestamped Output Filenames

We implemented automatic timestamped output filenames to ensure each processing run generates a unique output file. This was done by:

1. Creating a `_generate_timestamped_output_path` method in `MainTab` class that:
   - Generates a timestamp in the format "YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS"
   - Creates output paths with the pattern "{base_name}_output_{timestamp}.mp4"
   - Intelligently extracts the base name from existing paths

2. Modifying the `_direct_start_handler` method to:
   - Always generate a fresh timestamped output path for each run
   - Parse existing output paths to preserve the base name
   - Update the UI with the new path

3. Updating the start button validation logic in `_update_start_button_state` to:
   - Only require input directory (not output file)
   - Allow for automatic output file generation

## VfiWorker Integration

Fixed the integration between GUI and the VfiWorker class by:

1. Fixing parameter names in VfiWorker initialization:
   - Changed `out_file` to `out_file_path`
   - Changed `multiplier` to `mid_count`
   - Renamed Sanchez parameters to match VfiWorker's expectations:
     - `sanchez_enabled` → `false_colour`
     - `sanchez_resolution_km` → `res_km`
   - Renamed RIFE parameters:
     - `rife_tiling_enabled` → `rife_tile_enable`
     - `rife_uhd` → `rife_uhd_mode`

2. Properly connecting signals:
   - Changed signal names from previous implementation to match VfiWorker
   - Connected to correct handler methods

3. Added comprehensive error handling and debug logging

## Testing

Created test scripts to validate our changes:

1. `test_timestamp.py`: Validates the timestamp generation functionality
   - Tests default path generation
   - Tests custom base directory and name
   - Tests extraction of base name from existing paths
   - Tests multiple runs generating unique timestamps

2. `test_vfi_worker.py`: Validates VfiWorker initialization
   - Tests creating a VfiWorker with the correct parameters
   - Tests connecting signals to handler methods

## Summary of User Experience Improvements

1. **Start Button Functionality**:
   - The start button is now correctly enabled when an input directory is selected
   - No longer requires manual output file selection
   - Better validation logic that's more robust

2. **Output File Management**:
   - Automatically generates unique output filenames with timestamps
   - Preserves base names when regenerating timestamps
   - Format: "{base_name}_output_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.mp4"
   - Eliminates the risk of overwriting previous output files

3. **Better Error Handling**:
   - More robust handling of VfiWorker initialization
   - Better parameter validation
   - Improved debugging output

## Next Steps

1. Run the complete application to verify:
   - Start button enables correctly with just input directory
   - Output file is auto-generated with timestamp
   - File processing runs successfully
   - New timestamps are generated for each run

2. Consider adding options for:
   - Custom output directory selection
   - Custom base name configuration
   - Format options for the timestamp
