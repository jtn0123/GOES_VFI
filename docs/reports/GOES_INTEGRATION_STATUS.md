# GOES Satellite Imagery Integration Status

## Current Status

The GOES satellite imagery functionality has been successfully integrated into the GOES_VFI project. Here's a summary of the current status:

### Working Components

1. **Core Module (`goes_imagery.py`)**
   - ✅ Core classes (`GOESImageryManager`, `GOESImageryDownloader`, `GOESImageProcessor`)
   - ✅ Enumerations (`ProductType`, `ChannelType`, `ProcessingMode`, `ImageryMode`)
   - ✅ Unit tests passing

2. **UI Module (`goes_imagery_tab.py`)**
   - ✅ ImageSelectionPanel (UI for selecting imagery options)
   - ✅ ImageViewPanel (UI for viewing imagery)
   - ✅ GOESImageryTab (main UI component)
   - ✅ Integration tests passing

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - ✅ Unit tests (`test_goes_imagery.py`) - PASSING
   - ✅ Integration tests (`test_goes_imagery_tab.py`) - PASSING
   - ✅ UI demo test (`test_goes_ui.py`) - RUNNING SUCCESSFULLY

### Fixed Issues

The following issues were fixed to ensure compatibility with the current codebase:

1. **Imports**
   - Added missing `import botocore` in `goes_imagery.py`
   - Updated PyQt imports from PyQt5 to PyQt6 in test files

2. **PyQt6 API Changes**
   - Fixed method call from `app.exec_()` to `app.exec()` in test scripts
   - Updated alignment flags to use PyQt6 style (e.g., `Qt.AlignmentFlag.AlignCenter`)

3. **Test Improvements**
   - Enhanced test for showing images to avoid QPixmap mocking issues
   - Fixed temporary file creation and path handling in tests

## Next Steps

The GOES satellite imagery functionality is now properly integrated and tested. The following steps are recommended for further development:

1. **Full Integration**
   - The satellite imagery tab should be integrated into the main application interface
   - This could be done by adding it to the existing tab structure in the main window

2. **Documentation**
   - Update user documentation to include information about the satellite imagery functionality
   - Create examples and tutorials for using the different product types and channels

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Consider adding caching of recently accessed imagery
   - Implement background processing for large NetCDF files

4. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Add support for more satellite sources
   - Enhance visualization options (brightness/contrast controls, false color options)
   - Add time series visualization of satellite data

## Running the UI Component

The satellite imagery UI can be tested independently using the included test script:

```bash
source venv-py313/bin/activate
python test_goes_ui.py
```

This launches a window with the satellite imagery selection and viewing panels, allowing testing of the UI without requiring actual satellite data downloads.

## Test Status

| Test                      | Status  | Notes                                       |
|---------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| Unit Tests                | PASSING | All core functionality tests passing        |
| Integration Tests         | PASSING | All UI component integration tests passing  |
| UI Demo                   | WORKING | Interactive UI demo launches and functions  |
| mypy Type Checking        | PARTIAL | Some type errors still exist in the codebase |

## Technical Notes

1. **Usage of Boto3/Botocore**
   - The implementation uses unsigned access to S3 for public NOAA buckets
   - This requires proper setup with botocore.UNSIGNED configuration

2. **PyQt6 Migration**
   - The codebase has been updated to use PyQt6 instead of PyQt5
   - All Qt class method calls and constants follow the PyQt6 patterns

3. **Hybrid Fetching Strategy**
   - For recent data (<7 days old): Uses NOAA STAR CDN (faster, JPG format)
   - For historical data: Uses AWS S3 (NetCDF format with processing)
