# Integrity Check Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for fixing and enhancing the integrity check module in the GOES_VFI project.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Unit Test Issues

**Estimated time: 1-2 days**

1. **Fix AsyncMock Issues in CDN Store Tests**
   - Update `test_remote_stores.py` to properly use AsyncMock
   - Ensure all async context managers and methods are correctly mocked
   - Create test helpers for common async test patterns
   - Verify that CDN store tests pass consistently

2. **Fix Wildcard Key Handling in S3 Store Tests**
   - Enhance `S3Store.download` method to handle wildcard keys properly
   - Add test cases for both exact match and wildcard key scenarios
   - Implement pagination support for listing S3 objects
   - Verify that S3 store tests pass consistently

3. **Address PyQt Segmentation Fault Issues**
   - Create `PyQtAsyncTestCase` base class for async PyQt testing
   - Fix signal handling and event loop integration
   - Implement proper cleanup in test tearDown methods
   - Ensure test isolation to prevent cross-test contamination
   - Verify that enhanced view model tests run without segmentation faults

### Phase 2: Implement Integration Tests

**Estimated time: 2-3 days**

1. **Create IntegrityCheckTabTest Integration Class**
   - Implement test for tab initialization
   - Add tests for UI controls and their initial state
   - Add tests for basic interactions (button clicks, form changes)
   - Implement a test fixture system for satellite imagery

2. **Implement UI State Transition Tests**
   - Test state transitions between scanning, downloading, and completed states
   - Verify button enable/disable logic works correctly through state transitions
   - Test cancellation functionality and proper cleanup
   - Verify progress reporting updates correctly

3. **Add Error Handling Tests**
   - Test recoverable error handling (network timeouts, temporary failures)
   - Test unrecoverable error states (permissions, missing dependencies)
   - Verify error messages are properly displayed

### Phase 3: Additional Tests and Refinements

**Estimated time: 1-2 days**

1. **Add Disk Space Monitoring Tests**
   - Create a mock file system for testing disk space monitoring
   - Test disk space warnings and critical thresholds
   - Verify UI updates when disk space changes

2. **Create Satellite Imagery Mock Fixtures**
   - Implement a mock fixture system for satellite imagery
   - Create standardized test datasets for GOES-16 and GOES-18
   - Add support for different time intervals

3. **Performance and Edge Case Testing**
   - Test with large number of files (performance testing)
   - Test with unusual time intervals and date ranges
   - Test with incomplete or corrupted data

## Testing Strategy

For testing the integrity check module, we will use the following strategy:

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Focus on individual components (RemoteStore, TimeIndex, etc.)
   - Use mocking to isolate components
   - Ensure high code coverage for core functionality

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Focus on the ViewModel and Tab integration
   - Use controlled file system fixtures

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Test the full workflow from scan to download
   - Verify UI updates correctly reflect the system state
   - Use real file system operations for true verification

## Test Data Management

To manage test data effectively:

1. **Create a standardized test data generator**
   - Generate file patterns matching GOES-16 and GOES-18 naming schemes
   - Create test files with controlled timestamps
   - Support both complete and incomplete sequences

2. **Mock remote sources**
   - Create mock CDN and S3 responses
   - Implement latency and error simulation
   - Support both happy path and error cases

3. **Temporary test environments**
   - Use `tempfile` module for isolated test environments
   - Clean up all test artifacts after tests
   - Avoid dependencies between tests

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All test cases pass consistently without segmentation faults
2. Code coverage for the integrity check module is at least 85%
3. The integrity check tab functions correctly in the full application
4. All identified bugs are fixed and have regression tests

## Tooling

To support this implementation:

1. **Use pytest-qt for UI testing**
   - Install with `pip install pytest-qt`
   - Use QTest functionality for UI interaction testing

2. **Use pytest-asyncio for async testing**
   - Install with `pip install pytest-asyncio`
   - Use for more reliable async test execution

3. **Use qasync for PyQt/asyncio integration**
   - Install with `pip install qasync`
   - Use for proper event loop integration

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Complete Phase 1
- **Week 2**: Complete Phases 2 and 3
- **Week 3**: Integration with main application, final testing, and documentation
