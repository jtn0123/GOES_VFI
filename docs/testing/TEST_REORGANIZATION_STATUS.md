# Test Reorganization Status

## Overview

This document summarizes the work done to reorganize the test files in the GOES-VFI repository and provides a checklist for completing the process.

## What Has Been Done

1. **Created New Directory Structure**:
   - Created `examples/` directory with subdirectories for different types of examples
   - Created additional test directories in `tests/gui/` for better organization
   - Created `legacy_tests/` directory for potentially redundant tests

2. **Copied Files to New Locations**:
   - Copied example scripts to `examples/` directory
   - Copied tests to appropriate test directories
   - Copied potentially redundant tests to `legacy_tests/` directory

3. **Created Documentation**:
   - Created `docs/testing/test_organization.md` with detailed categorization
   - Created `docs/testing/redundant_tests.md` analyzing redundant tests
   - Created `docs/testing/test_organization_plan.md` with implementation plan
   - Created `docs/testing/test_structure.md` explaining the new structure
   - Created `legacy_tests/EVALUATION_CHECKLIST.md` for evaluating legacy tests

4. **Updated Test Runners**:
   - Updated `run_all_tests.py` to find tests in the new directory structure
   - Updated `run_fixed_gui_tests.py` to include newly organized GUI tests
   - Updated `run_fixed_integration_tests.py` to include newly organized integration tests
   - Updated `run_working_tests.py` to include newly organized unit tests

## What Needs to Be Done

The following checklist outlines the remaining steps to complete the test reorganization:

- [x] **Verify Test Functionality**
  - [x] Run all tests to ensure they still work after reorganization
  - [x] Fix any path or import issues that arise

- [ ] **Evaluate Legacy Tests**
  - [ ] Go through each test in the `legacy_tests/` directory
  - [ ] Compare with newer tests to determine if they're redundant
  - [ ] Decide whether to update, move, or remove each test
  - [ ] Update `EVALUATION_CHECKLIST.md` with decisions

- [x] **Update Examples**
  - [x] Ensure examples are properly documented
  - [x] Update any imports or paths in the example scripts
  - [x] Make sure examples run correctly

- [ ] **Clean Up Repository**
  - [ ] Remove original files (after verifying copies work)
  - [ ] Commit changes in a logical order (e.g., add examples, then tests, then remove originals)

- [x] **Update Documentation**
  - [x] Update main README.md to mention the examples directory
  - [x] Update CLAUDE.md with information about the test organization
  - [x] Make sure all test-related documentation is consistent with the new structure

## Current Status

Currently, the reorganization is in a transitional state:

- All files have been **copied** to their new locations
- Original files still exist in their original locations
- Test runners have been updated to reference the new locations
- The evaluation of legacy tests has not yet been completed
- Examples have been properly documented and verified to be working correctly

The verification of copied tests and examples has been completed. These files function correctly in their new locations with the proper import paths and configuration. 

The next step is to proceed with the evaluation of legacy tests and, once that's complete, the removal of original files.

## Recommendation

We recommend completing the evaluation of legacy tests before removing any original files. This will ensure that no valuable test code is lost in the reorganization process.

Additionally, we suggest updating the example scripts to have better documentation and clearer examples of the functionality they demonstrate.
